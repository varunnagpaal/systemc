SystemC
=======
Idea of this repo is to build SystemC projects at RTL,TLM abd Behavioral/Algorithmic abstraction levels.

Following are list of RTL sub-projects added so far

1. Generic Register

Following are the projects to be added as work progresses

1. Generic Shift-Register
2. IEEE Pipelined Floating Point Fused Multiplier Accumulator Unit (32-bit and 64-bit)
3. Generic Biquad IIR Filter IP
4. CIC Filter
5. I2C IP
6. SPI IP
7. 16450 UART
8. SERDES
9. Micro DMA IP
10. Coherent cache controller for Multicore NUMA CPU or GPU
11. ARM Processor Model (cortex M0)
12. FFT
